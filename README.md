# Collaborating with Git Branches

## Introduction

So far we've primarily presented Git as a version control system. Not only is Git a good version control system, it is also a marvelous tool for collaboration and team development. In fact, it was originally designed by Linus Torvalds for coordinating development for the Linux kernel. A primary mechanism through which Git collaboration can effectively be organized is the concept of branches. 

> Note: The figures here use the word `master` which is a legacy term that is still used in GitHub. It is more common now, and what you are likely to see, is `main`.

Two golden practices in collaborating with `git` are:

1. Keep the `main` or `master` _branch_ functional at all times
2. Keep lines of work ( _branches_ ) separate from each other

Let's explore `git` _branches_ and we'll come back to review why these golden practices are so helpful.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- Explain branches and their purpose in git  
- Create a new branch  
- Switch between branches  
- Use `git merge` to merge different branches  
- Identify and fix merge conflicts when merging branches

## Define a `git` branch

A `git` branch is a means to separate a new set of commits or edits from another branch. Typically we create a new branch off of `master` or `main`. If all developers we collaborate with honor golden practice 1, we can trust that `master` or `main` will be a safe starting point. 

When we branch, we're creating a separate parallel universe. We can experiment there without any adverse effects to the `master` or `main` branch. It's a contained sandbox where mistakes can be made or ideas can incubate.

It's an idea that a lot of fiction has presented in the last 50 years.

|Parallel Universe|Source|
|-----------------|------|
|Mirror Dimension | Dr. Strange (2016)|
|Darkest Timeline | "Community" / "Inspector Spacetime" |
|The entire premise of..| "Dr. Who" |
|Mirror, Mirror (Evil Kirk / Spock) | Star Trek|
|_Plot Against America_ | Philip Roth|
|The entire plot of...| "Primer" (2004)|

If you understand multiple-timeline fiction, you get the idea of branches.

By working in branches, collaborators can work without messing with the main timeline, known as `master` or `main`. OK, so how can we _actually_ leverage this reality-shattering idea?


## Create a new branch

Let's suppose a `master` branch with two commits:

<img src="images/new_image_git_1.png">


Best practices suggest that any new set of changes related to fixing a bug, creating a feature, or even messing around with experimental code in a "sandbox", should be started on a new branch.

In order to start a new branch, type: 

```
$ git branch <new-branch-name>
``` 

This creates a new branch. If you wish to see a list of all branches associated with a `git` repo, you can type: 

```
$ git branch -a
``` 

In case of a branch relating to writing a new feature, you could name the branch `add-preprocessing-and-normalization`. Thus: `git branch add-preprocessing-and-normalization` creates a new branch named `add-preprocessing-and-normalization`. This will take the entire commit history of the branch you're on (usually `master`) and make it the same history as on the `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` branch.

At this moment `master` and `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` **are the same branches / realities** etc. 

## Switch to a new branch

In order to start making changes on your new branch, you need to "check it
out." After checking a branch out, your commits will be added to that branch's
history. You move between branches with: 

```
$ git checkout <branch-name>
```

> **Protip**: You can create and checkout a new branch in one command using:
> `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`.  This will both create the branch
> `new-branch-name` and move into it by checking it out.

If you are currently on `add-preprocessing-and-normalization`, you can move back to `master`
with `git checkout master`. You can also type `git checkout -` in order to move
back to the previous branch.

When you add commits to a branch, you can see the history of the commits by typing: 

```
$ git log --graph
```


The `git log` command displays the history of commits
for the branch you're on.  The `--graph` "flag" tells `git` to make it pretty,
like a timeline. You can use "Space" to page down the history of commits. Use
`q` to exit.

Let's suppose we added two new commits to our new branch. We could visualize it
as:

<img src="images/new_image_git_2.png">

To make sure that you don't lose work, you should make sure all your changes
are committed before you switch branches. If you're doing work in
`add-preprocessing-and-normalization` that updates `model.py`, because `master` *also* has
a `model.py` file, `master` could overwrite your changes. Make sure all your
changes are committed before you switch branches.

> **Advanced**: `git` has a powerful feature called `stash` which can be used
> when you're ready to hold changes-in-progress. When you're very comfortable
> with `git`, look into it!


As you add more commits on the new branch you're changing _only_ the `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` reality. The `master` branch **will not be changed**. 

You can confirm this by first checking out `master` using `git checkout master`, then use `git log --graph` again, and you can see that the `master` branch _only_ has the code up to the moment you "branched" into the `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` timeline, er, branch.

The code from `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` is safely tucked away in that branch, waiting patiently in isolation from the rest of your code in `master` until the feature is considered complete. Let's talk about merging these commits into `master`.

## Merge a branch into master

Now that you have some additions to the code that you'd like to combine back with the `master`, the goal is to bring the commits that occurred on the `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` branch into the `master` branch. By merging the branch, `master` will have all of the commits from the `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` branch as though those events occurred on the `master` branch.

When merging a branch with `git merge`, it's important to be currently working on your target branch, the branch that you want to move the content to of the new branch. 


The first step for our `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` merge is to checkout `master` because that is where you want the commits to end up. You can then use `git merge <branch-to-merge> -m "message"` like shown here: 

```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge add-preprocessing-and-normalization -m "merge in the feature" 
```

Now the branches have been merged. If you type `git log --graph`, you'll see the commits from the `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` branch on your `master` branch.

Here's another way to visualize it:

<img src="images/new_image_git_3.png">

In this graphic, you might note that a commit happened to `master` _between_
the two commits that made up our feature branch. The amazing thing is `git`
reconciles the `master` timeline, the additional commit, and the commits in
this feature branch. It re-weaves multiple realities together. That is
_seriously_ cool.

When you're done with a branch that's been merged you can delete it with: 


```
$ git branch -d <branch-to-delete>
```

## Merge conflicts 

Occasionally, when merging two branches, you might run into a message similar to this: 

``` 
Auto-merging <filename>
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <filename>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. 
```

What happened here? Well, you made changes to the same file (`<filename>` in this case) on both the base and the feature branches, and now Git doesn't know which set of changes to retain. In order to resolve this, you need to manually fix the relevant file. To do this, first open the relevant file. After opening the file, you will see conflict markers -- `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch-name`. These markers indicate which portions of the file have conflicting changes. The markers and the conflicting changes are represented like this: 

```
...
...
everthing is fine here
<<<<<<< HEAD
...
...
this is the portion from the destination branch
=======
...
...
this is the portion from the source branch
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

All the lines between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` are the conflicting lines from the base branch and all lines between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch-name` are the conflicting lines from the `<branch-name>` branch. Here you can discard the set of conflicting lines of your choice and then delete the conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch-name`). After you do this, add and commit your changes so you can merge the branches without any issues. 

_Note: If there are multiple conflicts in the same file, each conflict is surrounded by conflict markers and it is your resposibility to resolve each conflict individually and remove all the conflict markers before you attempt to merge again._ 


## Keep your local repo up to date

When you are collaborating with several people on a project, it is important that you are always up to date with the changes others are making to the project. Not only will this ensure that you are always working with the latest version of the project, but it will also help reduce merge conflicts! 

Thus your local branches can merge in changes from remote repository branches just like they can do for local branches! To update a list of available branches at a remote we use: `git fetch <remote-name>`. Note this only updates the list of branches from remote repositories and not the local branches themselves. If you want to update the local branches, you have to merge. To give you a preview of what merging a remote branch workflow looks like: 

```
$ git fetch origin 
$ git checkout add-preprocessing-and-normalization 
$ git merge origin/laurens-preprocessing 
```

And now our local `add-preprocessing-and-normalization` has Lauren's ideas woven into it.

Alternatively, as a shorthand, you can fetch and then automatically merge the same-named branch from the remote using `git pull <remote-name> <branch-name-to-merge-in>`. 

## Explain the motivation of the "Golden Practices"

As developers we try to make sure that everyone has a clean place to start from: be that for writing a new feature or fixing a bug. Branching lets us keep `master` or `main` working at all times. If an emergency bug comes up, we know we have a
solid foundation to build from. Feature branches also help us look at `git log` and see what the intention of a feature was.

## Summary

Git is a complex tool, and these tools are just scratching the surface for collaborating with people. These workflows are just being introduced to you -- and it may be challenging for the time being. You'll have lots of time to practice them and get used to what each command does. Don't try to cram it all in at once; instead just start to get an understanding of what is at your disposal.
