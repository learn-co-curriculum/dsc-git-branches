    "# Collaborating with Git Branches\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've primarily presented Git as a version control system. Not only is Git a good version control system, it is also a marvelous tool for collaboration and team development. In fact, it was originally designed by Linus Torvalds for coordinating development for the Linux kernel. A primary mechanism through which Git collaboration can effectively be organized is the concept of branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The figures here use the word `master` which is a legacy term that is still used in GitHub. It is more common now, and what you are likely to see, is `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two golden practices in collaborating with `git` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep the `main` or `master` _branch_ functional at all times\n",
    "2. Keep lines of work ( _branches_ ) separate from each other\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore `git` _branches_ and we'll come back to review why these golden practices are so helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain branches and their purpose in git  \n",
    "- Create a new branch  \n",
    "- Switch between branches  \n",
    "- Use `git merge` to merge different branches  \n",
    "- Identify and fix merge conflicts when merging branches"

    "A `git` branch is a means to separate a new set of commits or edits from another branch. Typically we create a new branch off of `master` or `main`. If all developers we collaborate with honor golden practice 1, we can trust that `master` or `main` will be a safe starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we branch, we're creating a separate parallel universe. We can experiment there without any adverse effects to the `master` or `main` branch. It's a contained sandbox where mistakes can be made or ideas can incubate.\n",
